24th: initial meeting and started the repository in Github sent out invites to group members

26th: started base wrapper writing focusing on Error handling and input control in functions. Read about unit testing in R and setting up a testsuite compatable with Travis.

27th: Added warnings to the error handling to ensure user know of input errors and handled the errors with some corrections.

28th: Went over all the functions and standardized the use of packages, names of variables and structure of code so they are uniform and easy to maintain.  Changed their outputs to be a similarily structured database with consistent column heads.

29th: Wrote the unittesting packages.  Initially worked but on a push of a new codestructure needed for installation no longer working

1st: troubleshooting unit testing.  Cannot pass travis as Error on installation of the package will discuss with group.

3rd:  Package installs and passing build in travis

4th: Added some comments to functions

5th: Finished Readme file along with adding comments to last function.  Added build passing badge
