Product recalls occur when a manufacturer requests the return of a defective/unsafe product from a consumer. These products can be potentially harmful to the consumer and leave the manufacturer legally liable for their harm.

Unfortunately, unless glued to the news, a consumer may miss this information and become harmed. It's important to stay informed, and this wrapper for the Canadian Recalls and Safety Alerts API allows anyone to do so.

There are three main functions wrapped in canrecall.

### recall_api

used to parse recall data. The result is a dataframe.

There are 4 filters:

- category: an integer variable where 1 = FOOD, 2 = VEHICLES, 3 = HEALTH PRODUCTS, 4 = CONSUMER PRODUCTS
  
- lang: a string variable as 'en' = English, 'fr' = French for response language
  
- lim: an integer variable to limit results to n
  
- search: a string variable to search the database for
  
So, for the most recent 10 results for peanuts, in english, the function would look like:

    recall_api('peanuts', 'en', 1, 10)

### recall_api_date
similar to recall_api, but meant to parse recall searches by date. The result is a dataframe

Here, there are 5 filters:

- category: an integer variable where 1 = FOOD, 2 = VEHICLES, 3 = HEALTH PRODUCTS, 4 = CONSUMER PRODUCTS
  
- lang: a string variable as 'en' = English, 'fr' = French for response language
  
- datestart: a string variable for the lower date bound of the search
  
- dateend: a string variable for the upper date bound of the search
  
- search: a string variable to search the database for

So, to find recall data for costco, in english, in from 2005 to 2015, the function would look like:

    recall_api('costco', 'en, datestart = '1/1/2005', dateend = '1/1/2015')

Aggregating this data into a chart showing number of recalls per department looks like the following:

    df <- df_date %>%
      group_by(department) %>%
      summarise(counts = n()) 
    
    barplot(df$counts, names.arg=df$department)

### recall_api_recent
regardless of filter, retrieves the 15 most recent recalls.

This function only requires 1 parameter:

- lang: a string variable as 'en' = English, 'fr' = French for response language
  
The following code will return the 15 most recent recalls for all categories (75 total):

    r recall_api_recent('en')
